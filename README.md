## ðŸ›  Components & Libraries

### ðŸ”§ Hardware
- Arduino UNO  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- Dual DC Motors  
- Moving Belt System  
- Chassis Base Board  
- 9V/12V Battery Pack  
- Wires & Switches  

### ðŸ“¦ Software / Libraries
- Arduino IDE  
- Arduino.h (core functions)  
- Wire.h (I2C communication if sensors are used)  
- Servo.h (for optional servo control)  
- SoftwareSerial.h (for Bluetooth/serial communication)

## âš™ Implementation
Navigation commands are sent as characters:  

- F â†’ Forward  
- B â†’ Backward  
- L â†’ Left  
- R â†’ Right  
- S â†’ Stop  

Example Arduino code snippet:

```cpp
if (state == 'F') {
  digitalWrite(motorpin11, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motorpin12, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motorpin21, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motorpin22, LOW);
}
