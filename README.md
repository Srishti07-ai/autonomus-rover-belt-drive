# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Rover (Belt Drive System)

Designed and built an Arduino-powered autonomous rover with a belt-driven dual motor system, capable of terrain navigation, obstacle avoidance, and real-time control via serial commands.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Belt-driven mobility with dual DC motors  
- Forward, backward, left, right, and stop controls  
- Terrain adaptability with climbing ability  
- Obstacle avoidance and path correction  
- Arduino-based motor control with serial commands  

---

## ðŸ›  Components & Libraries

### ðŸ”§ Hardware
- Arduino UNO  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- Dual DC Motors  
- Moving Belt System  
- Chassis Base Board  
- 9V/12V Battery Pack  
- Wires & Switches  

### ðŸ“¦ Software / Libraries
- Arduino IDE  
- Arduino.h (core functions)  
- Wire.h (I2C communication if sensors are used)  
- Servo.h (for optional servo control)  
- SoftwareSerial.h (for Bluetooth/serial communication)  

---

## âš™ Implementation
Navigation commands are sent as characters:  

- F â†’ Forward  
- B â†’ Backward  
- L â†’ Left  
- R â†’ Right  
- S â†’ Stop  

Example Arduino code snippet:

```cpp
if (state == 'F') {
  digitalWrite(motorpin11, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motorpin12, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motorpin21, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motorpin22, LOW);
}
```
ðŸš€ How to Run

- Connect Arduino with L298N motor driver and dual DC motors.
- Upload the code (rover_code.ino) to Arduino via Arduino IDE.
- Power the rover using a 9V/12V battery pack.
- Use a Bluetooth module or serial monitor to send navigation commands.

ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Successfully navigated different terrains
- Efficient climbing performance on inclined surfaces
- Stable movement with obstacle handling
- Low power consumption with durable belt system

ðŸ”® Future Work

- Integrate LiDAR/camera for vision-based navigation
- Improve motor torque for steeper inclines
- AI-based path planning using ML
- Expand applications: exploration, disaster response, surveillance
